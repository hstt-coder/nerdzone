                <h2>Resident Evil 2</h2>
                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>
                    Two months after Resident Evil, most of Raccoon City citizens have been turned into zombies
                    by a leak of Umbrella's T-Virus. At a gas station outside town, rookie police officer
                    Leon S. Kennedy meets college student Claire Redfield, who is looking for her brother Chris.

                    After being separated in Raccoon City, Leon and Claire agree to meet up at the Raccoon
                    police department. The building is infested by zombies, and other monsters including the
                    T-00, or "Tyrant", dispatched to hunt down and kill any survivors. The creatures and
                    various obstacles prevent Leon and Claire from actually reuniting as they are forced to find
                    a way to escape Raccoon City.

                    Claire scenario
                    Claire learns Chris left on vacation and rescues young Sherry Birkin from a monster. Corrupt
                    police chief Irons, abducts Sherry and locks her in the orphanage. He later calls Claire to
                    trade a pendant Sherry dropped in exchange for her. Sherry tries to escape on her own, but
                    the monster returns and kills Irons. Claire and Sherry are cornered by Mr. X, who is killed
                    by the monster stalking Sherry; as a result, their elevator crashes and knocks Claire out.

                <h2>Tomb Raider</h2>
                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>
                    Tomb Raider, also known as Lara Croft: Tomb Raider between 2001 and 2007, is a media franchise that
                    originated with an action-adventure video game series created by British gaming company Core Design.
                    Formerly owned by Eidos Interactive, then by Square Enix after their acquisition of Eidos in 2009,
                    the franchise focuses on a fictional British archaeologist Lara Croft, who travels around the world
                    searching for lost artefacts and infiltrating dangerous tombs and ruins. The gameplay generally
                    focuses around action-adventure exploration of environments, solving puzzles, navigating hostile
                    environments filled with traps, and fighting numerous enemies. Additional media has grown up around
                    the theme in the form of film adaptations, comics and novels.

                    Lara Croft is the main protagonist and playable character of the series: she travels the world in
                    search of forgotten artifacts and locations, frequently connected to supernatural
                    powers. While her biography has changed throughout the series, her shared traits are her
                    origins as the only daughter and heir of the aristocratic Croft family. She is portrayed
                    as intelligent, athletic, elegant, fluent in multiple languages, and determined to fulfill her own
                    goals at any cost. She has brown eyes and brown hair worn in a braid or ponytail.
